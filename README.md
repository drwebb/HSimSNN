# HSimSNN
Haskell based simulator for spiking neural networks

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

- This project is very much in its infancy and doesn't do anything yet.

Goals
=====

    -- Event based simulation ? (Perhaps this should be a primary design
      criterion right from the start?) 
    
    Implementation goals
    --------------------

        (In the listed order)
        
        1) A basic spiking neuron model
        2) Populations of neurons
        3) Connections
        4) Network level simulations

Long term goals
===============

    (Not necessarily in the listed order)

    1) Synaptic plasticity
